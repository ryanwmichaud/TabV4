notes 

hashmaps can be enum - numbers are consecutive...

musicstring class doesnt really need hashmaps either - just open string
    we only really need to do subtraction
    is that more efficient?
    
    FINDING FRETS

        1. doing now
            declare and fill hashmap
            iteration
                look through position to position+stretch
                    if hashmap[curr] = noteToFind
                    iterate ...
        2.  better 
            declare and fill hashmap
            hashmap lookuptime
                foundAt = hashmap[notenum]   (right now I iterate through all)
                if it found it AND foundAt >= positionnotnum  AND  notenum <= positionnotnum +stretch 
        3.  maybe even better
            no map decalre or fill, just open
            is notenum between position and position notenum + stretch
                if notenum >= positionnotnum  AND  notenum <= positionnotnum +stretch
    
    RECURSION
        def a constant that the rec calls can access so that I dont need to keep passing the same variables!

        1. dupliacte checking after finding a solution. 
        does it use the first fret of the positon? if not, its shifted up version of somtehing else
        n checks for n strings 

        2. dupliacte check as part of feasible function
        when we use the first fret of a posiiotn, mark it as feasible, when to the end and well already know
        n checks for n recursions of backtrack...

        **add to one of these: at each postion check if first fret of any string even CAN be used for a chordtone BEFORE we backtrack. 
            n*12 checks for n strings, but could save us a ton of backtracking 


bruteforce is better than keeptrack 
preprocessing makes both faster - about the same - cant say which is better.
seems to hold for big and small practical numbers of chord tones and strings


FRONT END

refactor with functional components with hooks rather than classes
when it gets too narrow switch to mobile - hide and show left side menu
when it gets to one column of ct checkboxes - strighten left align
